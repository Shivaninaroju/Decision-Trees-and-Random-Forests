# 🌳 Decision Trees & Random Forests — Internship Task

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **Decision Tree & Random Forest models** on a classification dataset (Heart Disease / Breast Cancer as placeholder).  
It includes tree visualization, overfitting analysis, random forest comparison, and feature importance.  

## ✅ Objectives
- Train & visualize a decision tree  
- Analyze overfitting & control depth  
- Train random forest & compare accuracy  
- Interpret feature importance  
- Evaluate with cross-validation  

## 📊 Dataset
- Heart Disease dataset (from Kaggle)  
- For demo: sklearn's Breast Cancer dataset used here  

## 🧪 Results
- Decision Tree: accuracy & visualization  
- Overfitting shown with depth vs accuracy  
- Random Forest: higher accuracy than single tree  
- Feature importances plotted  
 

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.10+  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
